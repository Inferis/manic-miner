# Manic Miner

This is a vein miner mod. To activate, sneak and mine. No special enchantment needed (although I could add it upon request).

## Modes

This mod features 3 vein mining modes:
* regular ore veins (up to 128 blocks). This will also remove one layer of blocks next to the ore blocks to make it easier to collect ores. Includes nether ores.
* common block vein mining: makes it easy to create tunnels. Will mine up to 128 blocks of the same type in a cilinder shape in front of you (or above or below you). This works for a number of common building blocks (e.g. stone, andesite, deep slate, netherrack, end stone, tuff, ice, ...).
* trees: cut down whole trees in one go (192 block maximum).

### Configurable

* The amount of blocks for each type is configurable
* The mining of the extra layer of blocks around ore veins can be turned off.

## Modpacks

Feee free to use this in a modpack, just send me a ping, it's always nice to know if someone uses your code.
