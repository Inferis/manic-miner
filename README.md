# Manic Miner

This is a vein miner mod. To activate, sneak and mine. No special enchantment needed (although I could add it upon request).

The mod works serverside, so you (or your players) do not need to install this to work.

## Modes

This mod features 3 vein mining modes:
* regular ore veins (up to 128 blocks). This will also remove one layer of blocks next to the ore blocks to make it easier to collect ores. Includes nether ores.
* common block vein mining: makes it easy to create tunnels. Will mine up to 128 blocks of the same type in a cilinder shape in front of you (or above or below you). This works for a number of common building blocks (e.g. stone, andesite, deep slate, netherrack, end stone, tuff, ice, ...).
* trees: cut down whole trees in one go (192 block maximum).

You need to be using the right tool for vein mining to work (e.g. pickaxe for ores, shovel for dirt, axe for logs, ...). The mod respects the durability of the tool: once it runs out, you're done vein mining (obviously).

### Configurable

* The amount of blocks for each type is configurable
* The mining of the extra layer of blocks around ore veins can be turned off.

## Modpacks

Feee free to use this in a modpack, just send me a ping, it's always nice to know if someone uses your code.
